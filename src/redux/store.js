/*

Install the 'redux' and 'react-redux' libraries:
Copy code
npm install redux react-redux
Create a new directory in your project called 'store' and within it, create a new file called 'index.js'. This file will contain the store and the reducer for your application.

In the 'index.js' file, import the 'createStore' function from 'redux' and the 'Provider' component from 'react-redux'.

Create a new function called 'reducer' that will handle the state changes for your application. In this case, it will handle the color switch for the navbar.

In the 'reducer' function, handle the 'CHANGE_COLOR' action and update the state accordingly.

Create a new store using the 'createStore' function, passing in the 'reducer' function as an argument.

In your main component, import the 'Provider' component and wrap your entire application with it. Pass the store as a prop to the Provider component.

In the navbar component, import the 'useSelector' hook from 'react-redux' to access the state. And 'useDispatch' hook to dispatch the action to change the color of the navbar.

Use the 'useSelector' hook to access the 'color' property from the state and use it to set the background color of the navbar.

Use the 'useDispatch' hook to dispatch the 'CHANGE_COLOR' action with the desired color when the switch is clicked.

Test your application and make sure that the navbar color changes correctly when the switch is clicked.

Please note that this is a high-level overview of the steps required to implement Redux in a navbar component. Depending on your application's specific requirements, additional steps or modifications may be necessary.
